1. How to compile for question A:
	$g++ -o mainA mainA.cpp
2. And the result is 2032 because I use the same inputs of the example.
3. The explanation for question B:
	The time that sort function takes is only 10 times longer when the input is 10 times larger. But the one insertion sort takes is 100 times longer in the same circumstances. So the time that a O(n^2) algorithm takes wil rapidly increase when the input is large enough.
